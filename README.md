# MINT Scenario Games - Erasmus+ Project
 This repository contains the source code and documentation
 for the MINT Scenario Games, developed as part of the Erasmus+ Project.
 The project is a collaboration between L&K development GmbH, Holztechnikum Kuchl,
 and Ulrich-von-Hutten-Gymnasium Berlin, co-financed by the European Union.

## Project Description

### What are Scenario Games?
Scenario Games, inspired by online escape rooms, tackle cross-cutting themes such as climate change, society,
and sustainability in general, incorporating mathematical and scientific (MINT) tasks.
The objective is to stimulate creative thinking through gameplay,
reinforce subject knowledge, and enhance the integration of digitalization in classroom teaching.
The aim is to ignite new enthusiasm for MINT subjects.

### Gamified Learning
Through mathematical puzzles and a variety of question types,
participants are provided with the opportunity to apply their acquired knowledge in mathematics,
computer science, and natural sciences in a new context.

### Classroom or Home Use
Scenario Games can be of varying durations, ranging from short (approximately 5 minutes, similar to textbook exercises)
to very long (spanning multiple days). This allows scenarios to be used both in the classroom and as homework assignments.

### Flexibility
The Scenario Creator tool has been designed to offer a high degree of flexibility, enabling the creation of highly customized content tailored to individual teaching needs.

## Project Partners

### L&K development GmbH
L&K development GmbH, an experienced company in the field of education and e-learning, has successfully launched several apps and learning platforms.
In this project, L&K development GmbH will work closely with its project partners to develop a web app, as well as Android and iOS apps.
Their responsibilities include project coordination, programming, and overall project management.

### Holztechnikum Kuchl (HTK)
Holztechnikum Kuchl (HTK) is a vocational school in Kuchl, Austria, with a focus on wood technology.
The collaboration primarily involves the Höhere Technische Lehranstalt (HTL), which provides students from Austria, South Tyrol, and Germany with a practice-oriented education.

### Ulrich-von-Hutten-Gymnasium (UvH)
Ulrich-von-Hutten-Gymnasium (UvH) is a public school located in Berlin (Lichtenrade)
and is renowned for its commitment to sustainability, being awarded the "faire Schule" (fair school) label.
UvH contributed to the app development through project days, computer science classes, and elective courses.
